Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. 
This means that you can create mobile apps for both major platforms (iOs and Android) with only one codebase.

Example: You're a startup company, and you're running out of budget. Labor cost can be minimized here because you can reduce the amount of developer required. Thus, make your startup lean and efficient.

## Why you should learn Flutter?
1. Easy to learn - All the concepts are similar to web and mobile apps, if you already know the big picture of them such as padding, margin, button, etc. Everything is a widget, it's like connecting legos.
2. Fast to build - Hot reload.
3. Good performance - Closest thing to native or even the same in some cases. 
4. Strong community - Tons of resources to learn. 

## What Language do Flutter use?
Flutter uses Dart, and Dart is very similar to Java and Javascript. And Learning Dart is very easy, it's just a matter of syntax, if you already have programming fundamental knowledge, you'll be good to go.
